# Visualisation Dashboard for Insights into the Australian Aviation Industry

This visualisation explores Australiaâ€™s aviation industry, focusing on domestic airline routes, passenger flows, and airport operations. Key metrics such as passenger trips, aircraft trips, load factors, and distances between airports are presented using **Vega-Lite**, providing valuable insights for aviation authorities, policymakers, airlines, and researchers.

## How It Works

The visualisation is created using **Vega-Lite**, a powerful grammar for interactive visualisation. **Vega-Lite** allows for complex data visualisations with simple specifications, which are then compiled into Vega and rendered using **HTML**, **SVG**, and **Canvas**.

### Key Visualisations Include:
1. **Route Connectivity Map**: Displays key Australian airports and their connectivity based on the number of routes.
2. **Flight Delays and Cancellations (Stacked Bar Chart)**: Compares operational reliability across airlines by showing delays and cancellations.
3. **Airline Performance (Radar Chart)**: Compares Qantas, Jetstar, and Virgin Australia across several operational metrics like passenger load factor, trips, and cancellations.
4. **Passenger Volume by City (Bar Chart)**: Presents trends in passenger traffic from major cities like Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane over time.
5. **Aircraft Trips vs. Passenger Load Factor (Scatter Plot)**: Highlights the relationship between flight frequency and load factor efficiency for selected routes.

Data used for this visualisation was sourced from [Australian Government Open Data](https://data.gov.au/) and [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/). The datasets were pre-processed using **Python's Pandas library** to ensure consistency and accuracy.
