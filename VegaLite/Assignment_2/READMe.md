# Visualisation Dashboard for Insights into the Australian Aviation Industry

This visualisation explores Australia’s aviation industry, focusing on domestic airline routes, passenger flows, and airport operations. Key metrics such as passenger trips, aircraft trips, load factors, and distances between airports are presented using **Vega-Lite**, providing valuable insights for aviation authorities, policymakers, airlines, and researchers.

## How It Works

The visualisation is created using **Vega-Lite**, a powerful grammar for interactive visualisation. **Vega-Lite** allows for complex data visualisations with simple specifications, which are then compiled into Vega and rendered using **HTML**, **SVG**, and **Canvas**.

### Key Visualisations Include:
1. **Route Connectivity Map**: Displays key Australian airports and their connectivity based on the number of routes.
2. **Flight Delays and Cancellations (Stacked Bar Chart)**: Compares operational reliability across airlines by showing delays and cancellations.
3. **Airline Performance (Radar Chart)**: Compares Qantas, Jetstar, and Virgin Australia across several operational metrics like passenger load factor, trips, and cancellations.
4. **Passenger Volume by City (Bar Chart)**: Presents trends in passenger traffic from major cities like Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane over time.
5. **Aircraft Trips vs. Passenger Load Factor (Scatter Plot)**: Highlights the relationship between flight frequency and load factor efficiency for selected routes.

Data used for this visualisation was sourced from [Australian Government Open Data](https://data.gov.au/) and [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/). The datasets were pre-processed using **Python's Pandas library** to ensure consistency and accuracy.
